# Binary Stars.
Binary Stars is a simple astronomy application that draws the ellipse paths of 2 different stars and the intersections, if any, between these 2 paths.

## Description
The application takes inputs from the user: 
* Mass of each star.
* Radius of each star.
* Velocity of each star.
* Distance between the 2 stars.
Then, it uses it to calculate the **_eccentrity_ & _semi major_** for each star to calculate the _**change in distance**_ between them relatively to a specific point of view. Then, it plots the paths. Below is an example shown for the final execution of the application.
